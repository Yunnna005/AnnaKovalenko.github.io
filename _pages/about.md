Hey there! 👋 

I'm Anna, a passionate student in Computing with a focus on Game Development 🎮, driven by a love for creating immersive experiences and exploring the latest tech trends.

My journey into the world of game development began with a simple yet profound realization: from childhood, I always wanted to play the perfect game but could never find one, so I decided to create it myself. Since then, it's been an incredible adventure filled with learning, creativity, and innovation.🌟

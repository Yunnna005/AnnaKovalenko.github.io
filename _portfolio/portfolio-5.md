› Overview
------
I conducted a comprehensive software testing project on a Java class using various advanced techniques to ensure robust functionality and reliability.

Technologies Used: Java

GitHub: [link](https://github.com/Yunnna005/SoftwareTesting.git "Github")

› Techniques Used
------
1. Equivalence Partitioning
1. Test Conditions and Test Cases
1. Decision Table
1. State Transition Diagram
1. Parameterized Testing
1. Key Tests Conducted:

› Constructor and method testing
------
* Specification-based testing (positive and negative)
* Validated setAge method functionality with specific test cases
* Prioritized constructor testing as the initial test case
* Utilized JaCoCo for code coverage analysis

› Additional Considerations
------
Identified and added tests for uncovered code areas

Implemented error guessing techniques for further validation

› Outcome
------
Achieved a project rating of 72% to 100%, highlighting thorough testing and adherence to software quality standards.
